3/22/20 Even though I had a head start on this homework assignment I am upset with the outcome as of 3/22/20
I did not complete the project in it's entirety but will focus on getting past this before tuesday.
I was making good head way until I created a partial template for my navbar and spread it to my 3 total sites and after a few changes had 3 different navbars and while fixing them I realzed I was using flex but that requires a <div class=" container"> and though I feel stronger than I did when I started I fell behind.

-----------------------Things I will continue to fix and show a TA--------------------------------

*I will continue to study the responsive div and go back to review flex box, grid layout and media queries
*I will spend more time researching Navbars and get that back to a design close to the examples but still unique
*The UL inside of the navbar messed me up for over 2 hours so I will go back and figure out what is up with that
**The navbar UL would not center and was showing me a placement I did not agree with.
*I will go back to the portfolio page and create banners that lay ontop and towards the bottom of each image to create more context
*I will complete the form section on the contact page.

I have been touching on this index.html for the past week and have realized both some of strengths and weaknesses.
Weakeness:
Too many divs at first(ice sculpture design method) 
Do not understand to full extent the flex,box method, or styling.

Using Bootstrap for the main styling but for most part I prefer to use some custom styling.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Weakness that I overcome:
Too many divs at first(ice sculpture design method)(I would like to experiment with this and maybe some automation for future)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pros: I created a goofy vibe to the site and have begun mock up for sencond iteration

Relized the importance of both skeleton and reference code.

getting better at referencing w3schools,Bootstrap and mdn.

I had way bigger hopes for the first interation of my bio page however I found myself racing with the clock to re adjust given I was consistently adding and making changes. I avoided github for the entirety of the homework assignment because I need to have a  tutor session and review over that.
I need to know how to change picture sizes more accurately depending on the media size.
 Media quryes slowed me down.
